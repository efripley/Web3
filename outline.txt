Calendar App Outline

This document outlines the functionallity desired for the calendar app

1. User needs to be authenticated to view there calendar and prevent others from viewing their calendar
2. Calendar will have the same design as a paper wall calendar (rectangles representing days, 7 days per row labled above with the names of the days, enough rows for all the days of that month)
3. Users will have a way to switch from month to month (imitating page to page switch on a paper calendar)
4. Users will see a beautiful background with the calendar displayed on top
5. When a user clicks on a rectangle representing some day a popup will appear listing the items entered for that day.
6. User can edit delete and create items for a specific day.
7. User can search an event by keyword: This should flip to the month that the event occurs on and highlight that day in some way.
8. Maybe instead of a popup when a day is clicked or touched an info box at the bottom will populate (this would require less clicks to navigate between days)
9. Display weather on each of the days (detailed weather in the info box, icon/temp in upper corner of calendar day rectangle)
10. Calendar will be responsive. More details to come.
IF TIME PERMITS
11. Calendar will have users which belong to a family
12. Some users will have admin rights and be able to assign items to any member of the family
13. Non admin users can use the app as a task manager for themselves and choose which tasks or items are shared with the family and appear on the family calendar
14. Items can be nested (Lets say August 24th says grocery shopping. A user could nest their grocery list under the grocery task for that day)
15. Add reccuring tasks and template tasks (if you do something many times the same way then to have a template to load up with all the nesting already set up would be usefull)
